Peer Analysis Report - Boyer–Moore Majority Vote Algorithm,

1 Algorithm overwiev 
    -
    The main purpose of the Boyer–Moore Majority Vote Algorithm is to find the elements that appears more than half size of the array 
    It has two main phases : 
    -
      1 . Cantditate selection phase - iterates through an array maintaining a candidate and a count . When the count drops to zero , the current element becomes the new candidate 
      2 . Verification phase - checks if the candidate actually appears more than half size of the array
    This is the main purpose of the code. If and element more than the half times of the size of an array, it will become as an candidtae.
    
2 Complexity analysis
    Time complexity
      | Case             | Description                                             | Time Complexity |
      | Best Case        | The majority element dominates early, minimal switches  | Θ(n)            |
      | Average Case     | Candidate resets occasionally, full pass still required | Θ(n)            |
      | Worst Case       | Many different elements, candidate keeps changing       | Θ(n)            |
    Dervation 
      The first pass iterates once after over all n elements (O(n)) 
      The second pass (its verification) irreates once more over all n elemenets (O(n))
      Comvbined = 2n = Θ(n)
        There are no nested loops or recursion, so the ressurance relation is 
            T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) = > T(n) = O(n)
    Space compelxity
      Used constant helper varivables like candidate and count 
      No extra arrays are used
      Space complexity O(1)
    Summay
      | Metric             | Complexity |
      | Time (all cases)   | Θ(n)       |
      | Space              | O(1)       |
      | In-place           | Yes        |
      
3 Code Review & Optimization
    Identification of inefficient code sections 
        The verification phase always excecuted even if the candidate is dominant 
    Specific optimization suggestions with rationale 
        Adding input checks to handle empty arrays
    Proposed improvements for time/space complexity 
        Skip the verifiaction phase if the array is known to always have a majority element
        
4 Empirical Results 
    Benchmark setup
        Tested across multiple input sizes
            n = 100, 1000, 10000, 100000
        Measured total excecution time in (in ms)
            | Input Size (n) | Baseline Time | Optimized Time |
            | 100            | 0.1 ms        | 0.1 ms         |
            | 1,000          | 0.3 ms        | 0.2 ms         |
            | 10,000         | 1.8 ms        | 1.2 ms         |
            | 100,000        | 17.0 ms       | 10.9 ms        |
        In code itself done with ns to check the accrutate time 
            example :
                !!!!!!!CHEKS THE TIME OF EXACLTY THIS ARRAY MAY SLIGTLY CHANGE IF OTHER ARRAY IS USED!!!!!!!!!!!!
                Test array: 1 2 1 1 3 1 1 
                Expected: 1, Got: 1
            | Input Size (n) | Baseline Time |
            | 100            | 10900ns       |
            | 1,000          | 111000s       |
            | 10,000         | 598800ns      |
            | 100,000        | 2111300ns     |
            
  5 Conclucsion
    The Boyer–Moore algorithm is asymptotically optimal for majority voting problems.
    Theoretical and empirical results match perfectly — linear time, constant space.
    Minor practical optimizations (skipping verification when safe) can improve real-world performance.
    Code readability and maintainability could be improved via documentation and separation of logic.
